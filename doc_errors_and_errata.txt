This document is where I put any discrepancies I find in the book, Python Geospatial Analysis Cookbook.

page 1
Neither PySAL nor IPython are used anywhere throughout this book.
Either their usage should be demonstrated, or they should go to the back
of the book in the Appendix with the rest of the unused goodies.

In downloadable code, ch01/code/installer.sh
mkvirtualenv pygeo_analysis_cookbook
should read
mkvirtualenv pygeoan_cb

page 2
Under "Getting ready" it would be nice to provide a Vagrantfile with the code
and have it provision ch01/code/installer.sh

page 17
"enable global site-packages" needs to be removed from installer.sh.

8. Let's run our new ch03-08_dem2heightmap.py script from the command line:
subprocess.call(tif_2_envi.split(),shell=False)
9. Let's run our new ch03-08_dem2heightmap.py script from the command line:
python ch03-08_dem2heightmap.py

probably should read,

subprocess.call(tif_2_envi.split(),shell=False) <-- not in bold

python ch03-08_dem2heightmap.py

The username for pluto suddenly changes from "stars" to "secret".

Is geodata.ch08_e02_networklines_routing (as prescribed in the code)
the same as geodata.ch08_e02_networklines_vertices_pgr (as prescribed in the text)?

Can't find the following file:
state_unemployment = r'../www/html/US_Unemployment_Oct2012.csv'

page 241, step 7.
It is not clear why we need to create a new user named 'saturn'.
An explanation for why we can not use 'pluto' here would be very helpful.

page 241, step 9.
ALTER ROLE saturn SET search_path = django, geodata, public, topology;
should be in bold type.

page 242, step 10.
This isn't really a step telling the reader to do anything.
Suggest appending the contents of this step to the previous step.

page 242, step 11.
Need to touch __init__.py in maps folder before this line will work.


page 243
"We also need to let our new database user named saturn in order to have access to the 
tables located in the PostgreSQL geodata schema created in Chapter 8, Network Routing Analysis."
We need to let saturn do what?

geodata.ch08_e01_networklines_vertices_pgr
and
geodata.ch08_e02_networklines_vertices_pgr
do not appear to exist at this stage. Should they?

page 253
name='route-map' or 'routemap'?
The first appears in the pdf, the second appears in the code. Which is correct?

This line is confusing,
Next, register your new app in the /web_analysis/web_analysis/settings.py
INSTALLED APPS variable by adding this under the api entry 'maps' , under the entry 'api' .
Suggest changing it to something like,
Next, register your new app in the /web_analysis/web_analysis/settings.py
by adding 'maps' under the entry 'api' in the INSTALLED APPS variable.

page 254
Under "How to do it...", The authors say, "We use the built-in Django
template engine to build two HTML pages."  It would be nice to see how the
authors used the template engine to create said html files rather than just
printing showing us the result.

page 258, step 3
Consider changing the following, maps/views.py.
#################################################
For our application to actually show these templates, we need to create a view. The
view handles the request and serves route-map.html in return. Now, our simple
view is complete:
from django.shortcuts import render
def route_map(request):
    return render(request, 'route-map.html')

Where is e01_room_data.shp?

Where is e02_room_data.shp?
