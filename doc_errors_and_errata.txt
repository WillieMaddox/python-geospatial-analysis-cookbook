This document is where I put any discrepancies I find in the book, Python Geospatial Analysis Cookbook.

page 1
Neither PySAL nor IPython are used anywhere throughout this book.
Either their usage should be demonstrated, or they should go to the back
of the book in the Appendix with the rest of the unused goodies.

In downloadable code, ch01/code/installer.sh
mkvirtualenv pygeo_analysis_cookbook
should read
mkvirtualenv pygeoan_cb

page 17
"enable global site-packages" needs to be removed from installer.sh.

8. Let's run our new ch03-08_dem2heightmap.py script from the command line:
subprocess.call(tif_2_envi.split(),shell=False)
9. Let's run our new ch03-08_dem2heightmap.py script from the command line:
python ch03-08_dem2heightmap.py

probably should read,

subprocess.call(tif_2_envi.split(),shell=False) <-- not in bold
8. Let's run our new ch03-08_dem2heightmap.py script from the command line:
python ch03-08_dem2heightmap.py

The username for pluto suddenly changes from "stars" to "secret".
See also pages 165, 167, 177, and 195.

Is geodata.ch08_e02_networklines_routing (as prescribed in the code)
the same as geodata.ch08_e02_networklines_vertices_pgr (as prescribed in the text)?

Can't find the following file:
state_unemployment = r'../www/html/US_Unemployment_Oct2012.csv'

page 241, step 7.
It is not clear why we need to create a new user named 'saturn'.
An explanation for why we can not use 'pluto' here would be very helpful.

page 241, step 9.
ALTER ROLE saturn SET search_path = django, geodata, public, topology;
should be in bold type.

page 242, step 10.
This isn't really a step telling the user to do anything.
Suggest appending the contents of this step to the previous step.

page 242, step 11.
Need to touch __init__.py in maps folder before this line will work.


page 243
"We also need to let our new database user named saturn in order to have access to the 
tables located in the PostgreSQL geodata schema created in Chapter 8, Network Routing Analysis."
We need to let saturn do what?

geodata.ch08_e01_networklines_vertices_pgr
and
geodata.ch08_e02_networklines_vertices_pgr
do not appear to exist at this stage. Should they?
page 253
name='route-map' or 'routemap'?
the first appears in the pdf, the second appears in the code.


page 267, step 1
Where is e01_room_data.shp?

page 267, step 2
Where is e02_room_data.shp?
