This document is where I put any discrepancies I find in the book, Python Geospatial Analysis Cookbook.

page 1
Neither PySAL nor IPython are used anywhere throughout this book.
Either their usage should be demonstrated, or they should go to the back
of the book in the Appendix with the rest of the unused goodies.

In downloadable code, ch01/code/installer.sh
mkvirtualenv pygeo_analysis_cookbook
should read
mkvirtualenv pygeoan_cb

page 2
Under "Getting ready" it would be nice to provide a Vagrantfile with the code
and have it provision ch01/code/installer.sh

page 17
"enable global site-packages" needs to be removed from installer.sh.

In the second paragraph under "How it works...",
"This does not always work and some errors can occur."
And of course this didn't work for me. In particular with the bikeways.shp:
ERROR:  Geometry type (MultiLineString) does not match column type (LineString)
Either providing a recipe that does work, or providing an alternate solution
would be a welcomed addition.
For example, if using gdal v1.10 or later (which the book prescribes anyway),
then replace geometry_name with "PROMOTE_TO_MULTI" in the ogr2ogr Subprocess call.

page 52 step 1
Neither the python description nor the ogr2ogr command line script works:
running ogr2ogr on table: bikeways
ERROR 1: No field definitions found for 'bikeways', is it a table?
FAILURE: Couldn't fetch requested layer 'bikeways'!
running ogr2ogr on table: highest_mountains
ERROR 1: No field definitions found for 'highest_mountains', is it a table?
FAILURE: Couldn't fetch requested layer 'highest_mountains'!
Note: I had to prefix with geodata.highest_mountains for it to work.

page 53 step 1
What is mydatadump?
What is neighborhood?
What is parcels?
This discription of the commandline ogr2ogr command is vague and does not offer any useful insight.

Lots of warnings when importing osm files. Whether it be from osm web site, or using the san fran
file that comes with the downloadable code for the book. For example,

Is this to be expected? Some discussion regarding this issue would be helpful.

page 56
In the code file ch03-04_osm2shp.py, both ogrinfo and ogr2ogr should be in quotes
when passed as arguments to Subprocess. Windows users don't have to worry about
this since both ogr_info and ogr2ogr are string variables.
Also, defining ogrinfo as ogr_info is a recipe for a bug.

9. Let's run our new ch03-08_dem2heightmap.py script from the command line:
python ch03-08_dem2heightmap.py

probably should read,

It is not clear why we need to create a new user named 'saturn'.
An explanation for why we can not use 'pluto' here would be very helpful.

page 241, step 9.
ALTER ROLE saturn SET search_path = django, geodata, public, topology;
should be in bold type.

This isn't really a step telling the reader to do anything.
Suggest appending the contents of this step to the previous step.

"We also need to let our new database user named saturn in order to have access to the 
tables located in the PostgreSQL geodata schema created in Chapter 8, Network Routing Analysis."
We need to let saturn do what?

geodata.ch08_e01_networklines_vertices_pgr
and
geodata.ch08_e02_networklines_vertices_pgr
do not appear to exist at this stage. Should they?

page 253
name='route-map' or 'routemap'?
The first appears in the pdf, the second appears in the code. Which is correct?

This line is confusing,
Next, register your new app in the /web_analysis/web_analysis/settings.py
INSTALLED APPS variable by adding this under the api entry 'maps' , under the entry 'api' .
Suggest changing it to something like,
Next, register your new app in the /web_analysis/web_analysis/settings.py
by adding 'maps' under the entry 'api' in the INSTALLED APPS variable.

Under "How to do it...", The authors say, "We use the built-in Django
template engine to build two HTML pages."  It would be nice to see how the
authors used the template engine to create said html files rather than just
printing showing us the result.

Consider changing the following, maps/views.py.

For our application to actually show these templates, we need to create a view. The
view handles the request and serves route-map.html in return. Now, our simple
